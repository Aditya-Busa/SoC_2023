# SoC Project
This repository contains the codes from my Summer of Code 2023 Project. The project is on learning and implementing innovative strategies and indicators on PineScript(TradingView).

I have learnt Technical Analysis from scratch (Indicators,Strategies,Candle-Sticks,Back-testing)(From Zerodha Varsity modules)

I learnt the Fundamental Syntax and working of PineScript language from PineScript official documentation and YouTube links shared with us. I tried and learnt by executing several sample strategies and indicatiors from PineScript official Tutorial.
